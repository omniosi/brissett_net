BRIEF: Brissett.net no longer renders correctly. Code inspection shows that something in this WordPress codebase is broken. Client does not have access to the source code as it is on a developers server. This site needs to be rebuilt and hosted on a server the client has access to.

TODO:

1. Pull each page of code from the live site.
2. Reformat code as static HTML and not as a WordPress CMS.
3. Re-create the site logo.
4. Recreate the header background art.
5. Re-layout the site.
6. Re-link each page.
7. Acquire and layout icons.
